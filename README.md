### Problem 4: How old are Saturnians?

It takes Saturn approximately 10,759 Earth-days to orbit the sun. In the file
**[SaturnianToEarthAgeConverter.py](SaturnianToEarthAgeConverter.py)**, write a function
**`saturnian_to_earth_age_converter`** that will translate a Saturnian's age into Earth units. Take a look at the
sample behaviour below:

```text
How old is the Saturnian you are talking to? 10
This Saturnian is 294 Earth-years, 9 Earth-months, and 24 Earth-days old.
```

For this problem, you may assume that Earth-years are always 365 days long, and Earth-months are always 30 days long.
